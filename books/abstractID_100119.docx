Due to the huge dependency of the developed country, Readymade garment (RMG) is growing faster in an unplanned manner. The procedures of manufacturing and finishing textile materials require a high volume of water which ends by the direct deposition of the effluents into the waterbody. The study was conducted to investigate the wastewater quality parameters discharged from four textile dyeing industries (Jeans Culture Ltd., Standard Group Ltd., ARK Fashions Ltd., and J.K. Fashion Ltd.)  located at Mirpur in Dhaka North City Corporation of Bangladesh during September 2017. The investigation was done by collecting the influent and effluent water samples by the purposive sampling technique. The samples were analyzed for nine different parameters (pH, Color, Turbidity, Hardness, Chloride, total dissolved solids (TDS), total suspended solids (TSS), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). The assessment included the water quality that meets the criteria for both drinking purpose and inland surface water quality set by ECR’97. The pH and chloride values of the influent and effluent were found in between the range for both standards. Color, turbidity and Hardness values for wastewater before and after treatment were found to be much higher than the acceptable limits. The Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) and Total Suspended Solid (TSS) values of the outlet water from effluent treatment plant (ETP) were also found beyond the standard limits for drinking purpose but some of them are in the range of inland surface water quality standards. The study has revealed that the effluent is not permissible to drink without proper treatment and careless discharge should be discouraged to reduce water pollution to ensure a healthy environment. </p><span style='font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: 50px'>Keyword: </span><span>Textile industry, influent, effluent, inland surface water quality, different parameters.</span></div></body></html>
