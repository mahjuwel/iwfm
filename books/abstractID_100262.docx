Being situated on the Brahmaputra River Delta (also known as the Ganges Delta) and the many distributaries flowing into the Bay of Bengal, the country is prone to flood. Due to the geographical location, flooding is an acute problem for the country to manage every year. Besides, topography and geological features, soil water absorption capability, and vegetation of a particular area is totally different from other areas. Additionally, socioeconomic condition, unplanned urbanization, environmental degradation and bilateral relationship with neighboring countries donâ€™t allow the government to take appropriate action with the existing workable options prevailing for other developed countries. Thereby, a pragmatic and smart solution is required to meet this overwhelming challenge. However, in this paper, an analysis of the problem with analyzing tools was carried out, which paved the way to the smart solution. Furthermore, single solution for the whole country is not only suitable but also detrimental for the adjacent areas. Considering all those aspects, this paper proposes an area based solution integrated with various options to minimize flooding issue in Bangladesh. The solution is anchored to district and township based specified solution. Solution for Tangail-Jamalpur and Dhaka is projected in the paper as an example. The area-based solution will be a combined flood prevention system incorporating both engineering & non-engineering options. It can be applied for a flood-prone district and a township basing on the specific causes (elevation, drainage system, low lying land, water clogging) of flood for that particular area. This study also highlighted a 10 years implementation plan for the proposed solution. Moreover, detail study on geographical, demographical and municipality data will enrich this paper with more specific district wise area based solution for the problem.</p><span style='font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: 50px'>Keyword: </span><span>Flood hazard, Smart Dam, River training, UG Discharge channel, Automatic Drainage cleaning system.</span></div></body></html>
