The vast wetland has its unique ecosystem and environment with hundreds of flora and fauna species. This ecologically rich area is at risk because of various activities. Environmental degradation and decreasing biodiversity are the main causes behind its inclusion as an ECA (Ecologically Critical Area). Loss of vegetation is one of the most threatening reasons for the areaâ€™s environmental degradation. In order to detect changes in land cover and NDVI, remote sensing technology and geographic information systems (GIS) has been used as an accurate and quick method. This study aimed to assess the changes in land cover and vegetation density (NDVI) between 1988 and 2018, as well as obtaining the density of vegetation (NDVI) on each of the land cover from 1988 to 2018. Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-8 OLI images have been used for analysis. The study area was divided into 4 land types which are dense vegetation, moderate vegetation, sparse vegetation and no vegetation. The study finds that in 1988, 1.23% areas were densely vegetated, and 29.57% areas were marked as no vegetation area. This scenario changed to 2018 as 0?nsely vegetation area and 63.39% no vegetation area. Land cover change has happened in every direction. But the most changes were found from moderate to no vegetation, 2923.54 ha and from sparse to no vegetation, 4916.72 ha area. In 30 years, decrease rate of each land type for dense, moderate and sparse was respectively 8.598 ha/year, 195.06 ha/year and 32.91ha/year. The highest NDVI value in 1988 was found 0.65812, but in 2018, it was 0.472. </p><span style='font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: 50px'>Keyword: </span><span>NDVI, Hakaluki Haor, Landsat, vegetation, Land cover</span></div></body></html>
