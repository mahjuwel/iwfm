Current remote-sensing flood index insurance contracts in Bangladesh rely on optical satellite sensors (MODIS) for flood detection. Radar-based satellites can penetrate clouds, offering more consistent mapping during flood events by detecting changes in radar backscatter. Yet identifying damaging flood events with radar presents challenges in Bangladesh due to the presence and regional variation of widespread seasonal flooding, irrigation inundation, and permanent water. 
Here we present a method to estimate surface water extent from the Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Satellite (every 2-10 days at 10m resolution since 2017) for different regions in Northern Bangladesh. A surface water time series is developed in Google Earth Engine from the DeVries et al. (2020) Sentinel-1 Flood mapping algorithm. Several adaptations are made to better suit application in Northern Bangladesh: a dry-period baseline period is derived from the NASA SMAP Soil Moisture Time Series, spatial smoothing is performed over each pixel, and dry-season surface water is added from the Sentinel-2 optical sensor in order to better represent true surface water extent.
The surface water time series is cross-correlated to localized river water level data to assess consistency in the signal. The algorithm is then spatially validated with accuracy maps over 4 large flood events using coincident PlanetScope imagery at 3m resolution. Results show significant cross-correlation between river water level and the surface water time series (CCFavg = 0.753, pavg = 0.0), high spatial accuracy in all 4 flood events (F1avg = 0.907) and low spatial bias in 3/4 flood events. These time series and spatial comparisons show that despite limits in observation frequency, Sentinel-1 provides an inundation time series with a consistent flood signal and accurate imaging, thus suitable for index insurance triggers.
