So, more and more researches are necessary for taking effective actions to help the affected people fight against erosion. Riverbank erosion can be divided into two categories, hydraulic erosion (occurred by lift and drag of channel flow) and subaerial erosion (occurred by dynamic soil moisture conditions). About 80 km reach length of Surma River, situated in four subdistricts (Kanaighat, Zakiganj, Beanibazar and Golapganj) of Sylhet was taken in this study. Only hydraulic erosion was studied in this paper because soil samples collected and examined from the study area were found to be cohesive and silt-clay content (%) was low which are major indicators of hydraulic erosion. A relatively new term, stream power (product of flow discharge, channel slope and weight of water) was used and calculated in this study which has not been used to evaluate riverbank erosion in Bangladesh before. Channel flow creates shear stress in riverbank and from this shear stress, stream power was calculated. Two independent properties of shear stress, flow magnitude and flow duration were used. Then, the relation between effective cumulative stream power and bank erosion was evaluated and direct connection was found. Also, effects of flow magnitude and flow duration on riverbank erosion were evaluated and direct relation was found. Bank shifting in 11 different stations of the study area of Surma River for the last 30 years were calculated and the results were validated by calculations done by using satellite images. Arc-GIS, HEC-RAS, Microsoft Excel were used as necessary tools in this study. </p><span style='font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: 50px'>Keyword: </span><span>Hydraulic erosion, Stream power, Flow magnitude, Riverbank erosion, Riverbank shifting    </span></div></body></html>
