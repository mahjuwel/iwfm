Over the last 20 years, the total annual rainfall in Chittagong has remained unchanged, although urban development has taken place, increasing the city's impervious area, with the consequent increase in the rainfall-runoff. However, an adequate drainage system to cope with the increased runoff has not built-up during this time. On top of that, the length of khals in Chittagong city has decreased along with their drainage capacity. So the increased surface runoff is not draining out properly by the existing drainage system.  With the acceleration of the urbanization process, urban water logging problems are becoming more severe in Chittagong, and rainwater harvesting can be a possible solution, ameliorating the predicament. Thus this study aims to work out the feasibility of rainwater harvesting for Chawkbazar, a populated ward of Chittagong (ward no -16) with an area of about 2.4 km2. Based on large-scale topographic map data and the long-term rainfall data, the types of underlying surfaces were classified. The potentiality of collectible rainwater and the possibility of runoff volume reduction was calculated. The results showed that the exploitation of rainwater harvesting from rooftops and other underlying surfaces has high potential. Rainfall intensity is calculated by using the study area's existing drainage capacity, to be 12.89 mm/hr, which is found lower than the daily maximum rainfall intensity, 16.875 mm/hr. The annual collectible rainwater is found to be approximately 1114706.166 m3. It is observed that 37.8% of total surface runoff can be reduced by collecting rainwater from rooftop harvesting every month. It is hoped that this research may help the related organization and experts solve this problem.  </p><span style='font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: 50px'>Keyword: </span><span>Rainwater Harvesting, Chittagong, Rooftop, annual collectible rainwater, surface runoff </span></div></body></html>
