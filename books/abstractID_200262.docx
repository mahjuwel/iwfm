The aim of this paper is to analysis how user’s behavior & climate change affect the water demand for urban area. Some questionnaire was used as a data collection tools with different parameters. There exists a strong correlation (R2> 0.5) between the parameters like water used for shower, laundry, cocking, toilet flashing, indoor taps etc. We adopt Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to show the relations among the parameters. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) model identifies a reliable measure among the variables. The model fit parameters (CFI>0.45 & RMSEA&lt;0.08) indicates the strong relationship among the variables. Our study found that, user’s behavior & other climate change has great influence in water crisis in urban area. Climate impact is less but the waste of water during daily activities (cocking, toilet, shower, flashing etc.) has great impact in reducing water level & thus resulting water crisis. </p><span style='font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: 50px'>Keyword: </span><span>Water crisis, Urban area, Climate change, Water level, Structural Equation Modeling(SEM).</span></div></body></html>
