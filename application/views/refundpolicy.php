<p>Thank you for registering at icwfmconference.</p>

    The 8th ICWFM will be held in a situation when the whole world is struggling to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. The world has seen a new dimension of water and flood management during this condition. Although the natural system remained indifferent to this pandemic, the human system responded differently during disasters compared to its normal response. People were reluctant to move, and evacuation became difficult. In this context, the 8th ICWFM expects to generate some new insight into water and flood management.
