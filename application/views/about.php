<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>The International Conference on Water and Flood Management has been organized by the Institute of Water and Flood Management (IWFM) of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) biennially since 2007. ICWFM 2021 is the 8th event. Water management in general and flood management, in particular, is an interdisciplinary field that needs integrated knowledge from multidisciplinary fields, including hydrology, hydraulics, morphology, atmospheric science, climate, environmental pollution, ecosystem, agriculture, disaster, vulnerability, risk, gender, livelihood, and poverty. With changing physical and socioeconomic risks due to changes in climate and anthropogenic interventions, integrated approaches to analyzing these processes and their interactions, along with integrating nature-based solutions, are gaining traction. This conference aims to act as a common platform for bringing together the recent development in the above fields.

The 8th ICWFM will be held in a situation when the whole world is struggling to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. The world has seen a new dimension of water and flood management during this condition. Although the natural system remained indifferent to this pandemic, the human system responded differently during disasters compared to its normal response. People were reluctant to move, and evacuation became difficult. In this context, the 8th ICWFM expects to generate some new insight into water and flood management.

There will be many ‘new’ in this event of ICWFM. The platform of this 8th event of ICWFM will be new. For the first time since its inception, the entire conference will be held in an online platform. It is expected that this new platform will bring a wider community of its kind together to express and exchange their findings and thoughts. For the first time, the conference will be completely free for the students. It is expected that this will attract many new emerging scientists to share their findings on a global platform.

Unlike the previous events, the 8th ICWFM does not have a central theme. Rather papers are invited from multidisciplinary fields with the expectation that at the end of the day, new insight will emerge that will shed light on the interdisciplinary nature of water and flood management.</p>
